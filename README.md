# üåû Image Correlation Analysis Tool for Sequential Images (IDL)

This repository contains a general-purpose IDL script for analyzing solar FITS data, originally developed for Nobeyama Radioheliograph datasets. It extracts features like longitudinal and latitudinal shifts, rotation rate , and correlation metrics and logs them in a structured way for further scientific analysis. This code can be used for any further studies only after citing our paper Routh et al (2024), Routh et al (2025) and Mishra et al (2024). The BibTex entries for citation is given below.

## üîß Features

- Processes solar FITS image sequences
- Computes latitude-binned outputs like:
  - Longitudinal shift (œÜ)
  - Latitudinal shift (y-shift)
  - Rotation (œâ)
  - Cross-correlation values
- Writes tabular outputs to structured `.dat` files
- Easy customization of:
  - Latitude bins
  - Year-specific outputs
  - Data directory paths

---

## üõ† Requirements

- [IDL](https://www.l3harrisgeospatial.com/Software-Technology/IDL) (Interactive Data Language)
- FITS handling libraries (`astrolib` and `SolarSoft`)
- Data: FITS files in a consistent time-series format (e.g., `*.fits`)

## üìÅ Directory Structure

```
your_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ solar_corr_analysis.pro     # Main IDL procedure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ results/                    # Output `.dat` files saved here
```

## üöÄ Usage

You can run the tool directly in IDL:

```idl
IDL> .r image_correlation
IDL> image_correlation, data_dir='/path/to/fits/', output_dir='./results/', year=2022
```

### Arguments

| Parameter     | Type   | Description                         |
|---------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| `data_dir`    | string | Directory where input FITS files are stored |
| `output_dir`  | string | Folder where `.dat` files will be saved |
| `year`        | int    | Year (used in file naming)         |

## üî¨ What This Code Actually Does

This tool processes time-series solar FITS files, converts them to heliographic coordinates and computes correlation coefficients between sequential latitudinal bin pairs.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **FITS File Discovery**:
   - Searches for all FITS files matching the pattern `ifa*.fits` in the provided directory.

2. **Loop Over FITS File Pairs**:
   - Iterates over consecutive pairs of images (i.e., `file[k]` and `file[k+1]`).

3. **FITS Metadata Extraction**:
   - Reads image data and header using `MRDFITS`.
   - Extracts:
     - Observation frequency (`OBS-FREQ`)
     - Observation date/time (`DATE-OBS`, `TIME-OBS`)
     - Solar disk coordinates (`CRVAL1`, `CRVAL2`)

4. **Timestamp Handling**: (originally taken as a step of precaution against non-uniform timestamp format in the Nobeyama datasets)
   - Converts date formats from slashes (`/`) or dashes (`-`) into standard format. (Ignore this step if your dataset has uniform format for timestamps)
   - Computes time difference `dt` (in days) using `anytim2tai`.

5. **Validation Checks**:
   - Ensures:
     - Both FITS files have valid solar center positions (`CRVAL1`, `CRVAL2` ‚â† 0)
     - Time difference ‚â§ 1.25 days
     - Both images have the same observation frequency

6. **Analysis**:
   - Once validated, the images disk masked and projected to heliographic grid , using heliographic.pro and are ready for further analysis like:
     - Longitudinal drift (œÜ)
     - Rotation (œâ)
     - Y-shift
     - Cross-correlation over latitude bands

7. **Structured Output**:
   - Results are written into `.dat` files, each named by the measurement type and year.
